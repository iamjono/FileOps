The Most Beautiful
by M.J. Lemon

Alive in doubt danger or hope
from burial to birth- Acceptance
of any invitation makes for grief or mirth
More often taken and spilled

Than honoured and cherished- 
in absentia the clay is clay.
Its life courses through corridors
not sanguine but imperturbable

As I rush past, you stop
you- tranquil, free; 
I feel in control but where
senses angle inward

The wonder on earth, 
the most beautiful being
blossoms in shadows fleeting
with one too arrested, unseeing
